  <h1 class="center-heading">Impact of presence of Storage Facilities near their farms on Farmers</h1>
  <h1>Advantages of Storage Near Farmers</h1>
  
  <div class="advantage">
    <h2>1. Reduced Transportation Costs</h2>
    <p>By having storage facilities near farmers, transportation costs can be significantly reduced. Farmers can store their produce nearby, eliminating the need for long-distance transportation to distant storage facilities. This helps in saving fuel costs and reducing the overall carbon footprint.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="advantage">
    <h2>2. Enhanced Quality Control</h2>
    <p>Storing crops near farmers allows for better quality control. Farmers can monitor their produce closely and ensure optimal storage conditions, such as temperature and humidity, resulting in improved product quality. This reduces the chances of spoilage and increases the shelf life of the crops.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="advantage">
    <h2>3. Increased Flexibility</h2>
    <p>Proximity to storage facilities provides farmers with increased flexibility in managing their harvest. They can choose the right time to sell their produce, taking advantage of favorable market conditions. Farmers can also store surplus produce during high-yield seasons and release it gradually when the prices are more favorable.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="advantage">
    <h2>4. Timely Processing and Distribution</h2>
    <p>Storage facilities near farmers enable timely processing and distribution of agricultural products. Farmers can quickly deliver their crops to nearby storage units, where they can be sorted, processed, and distributed efficiently. This ensures that fresh produce reaches the market faster, reducing the time between harvest and sale.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="advantage">
    <h2>5. Minimized Post-Harvest Losses</h2>
    <p>With nearby storage options, farmers can minimize post-harvest losses. Proper storage facilities help in preserving the quality and quantity of crops, preventing spoilage and waste. By reducing post-harvest losses, farmers can maximize their profits and contribute to food security.</p>
