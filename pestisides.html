        <h1 class="center-heading">Impact of Use of Pesticides on Farmers</h1>
  
  <div class="impact">
    <h2>1. Health Risks</h2>
    <p>The use of pesticides exposes farmers to various health risks. Direct contact with pesticides or inhalation of toxic fumes can lead to acute and chronic health issues. Farmers may experience skin irritation, respiratory problems, neurological disorders, and even certain types of cancers. Long-term exposure to pesticides can have serious consequences on the overall well-being of farmers.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="impact">
    <h2>2. Environmental Pollution</h2>
    <p>Pesticides have a significant impact on the environment. When pesticides are sprayed on crops, they can contaminate the soil, water sources, and surrounding ecosystems. This contamination affects not only the targeted pests but also beneficial insects, birds, and other wildlife. Pesticide residues can persist in the environment, causing long-term damage to biodiversity and disrupting the delicate balance of ecosystems.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="impact">
    <h2>3. Soil Degradation</h2>
    <p>The use of pesticides can lead to soil degradation. Pesticides can kill beneficial microorganisms and reduce soil fertility. Continuous and excessive pesticide use can disrupt the natural soil ecosystem, making it less resilient and more prone to erosion. Soil degradation negatively impacts crop productivity and sustainability, posing long-term challenges for farmers in maintaining healthy soil for sustainable agriculture.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="impact">
    <h2>4. Resistance and Pest Management Challenges</h2>
    <p>Overreliance on pesticides can result in the development of pesticide resistance in pests. Continuous exposure to pesticides can lead to the evolution of resistant pest populations, making it difficult to control them effectively. Farmers then need to rely on stronger or more toxic pesticides, escalating costs and further exacerbating environmental and health risks. This creates a cycle of dependency on pesticides and challenges in implementing sustainable pest management practices.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="impact">
    <h2>5. Economic Implications</h2>
    <p>The use of pesticides can have economic implications for farmers. Pesticides can be costly, and excessive use can lead to increased production expenses. Additionally, environmental damage caused by pesticides can impact the availability and quality of natural resources necessary for farming, such as water. Farmers may face decreased crop yields, increased input costs, and market challenges due to consumer demand for pesticide-free or organic produce.</p>
