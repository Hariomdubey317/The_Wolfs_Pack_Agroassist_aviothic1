    Crop planting is influenced by seasons and locations to optimize growth and maximize yields. Different crops have specific temperature, moisture, and daylight requirements, which vary across seasons and geographical regions. Here's a general guide on crops planting based on seasons and locations:
    
    Spring Planting:
    
    Cool-season vegetables: Examples include lettuce, spinach, peas, broccoli, carrots, radishes, and kale. These crops prefer cooler temperatures ranging from 50°F to 70°F (10°C to 21°C).
    Root crops: Potatoes, beets, turnips, and onions can be planted in spring, but they have different temperature preferences. Check the specific requirements for each crop.
    Some fruits: Strawberries and certain types of berries can be planted in early spring.
    Summer Planting:
    
    Warm-season vegetables: Tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, corn, beans, squash, eggplant, and melons thrive in warm temperatures ranging from 70°F to 90°F (21°C to 32°C).
    Herbs: Basil, cilantro, dill, and other herbs prefer warm weather.
    Some fruits: Watermelons, cantaloupes, and certain varieties of grapes and berries can be planted in summer.
    Fall Planting:
    
    Cool-season vegetables: Many cool-season crops can be planted in fall for a second harvest. Examples include cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, beets, and radishes.
    Leafy greens: Lettuce, spinach, and other leafy greens can be grown in the cooler temperatures of fall.
    Some herbs: Chives, parsley, and certain herbs can be planted in fall.
    Garlic and onions: Fall is an excellent time to plant these bulbs for a harvest the following year
